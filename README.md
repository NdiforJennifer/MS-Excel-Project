**MS Excel Project**

According to Wikipedia, Microsoft Excel features the basic characteristics of all spreadsheet applications. It organizes data using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns, allowing for various data manipulations, including arithmetic operations. Excel offers a comprehensive set of functions to meet statistical, engineering, and financial needs. Additionally, it can display data through line graphs, histograms, charts, and a limited three-dimensional graphical display.

In my Microsoft Excel project, I explored numerous functions, including the MAX/MIN function, IF function, LEN function, LEFT/RIGHT functions, TRIM function (which removes unwanted spaces from both sides), and date-to-text conversions. I also worked with functions like CONCATENATE, SUM, SUMIF, SUMIFS, SUBSTITUTE, COUNT, COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, and DAYS/NETWORKDAYS, among many others that cannot all be highlighted here.

Furthermore, I delved into conditional formatting, a feature that effectively highlights trends and patterns in your data using bars, colors, and icons to draw attention to important values. I examined various rules, including highlighted cell rules, top/bottom rules, data bars, color scales, and icon set rules.

Additionally, I created several charts, which can be found below
 
 
 
 
 

 


**Data Cleaning in Excel**
Using the data from the data cleaning tutorial, I first copied the file to a new sheet for the cleaning process.

I performed the following tasks:

1. Removed all duplicates.
2. Changed all names to proper case.
3. Replaced names in the party column.
4. Used the TRIM function to eliminate any extra spaces.
5. Removed currency symbols from the data.
6. Standardized and corrected all dates.

All the columns I worked on have been highlighted in yellow.
